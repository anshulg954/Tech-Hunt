# APRATIM 2K19 CSE Tech-Hunt
This repository contains program files, research papers, and the question pdfs for the CSE TECH HUNT EVENT.
## Event Details
* It was a 45-minute event.
* Each team was initially given 3 basic questions on programming, solving which they had a clue to navigate to the correct folder amongst all the  folders provided to them earlier.
* The root folder contained password 10 protected pdfs.
* Each PDF had the clue or password to the next pdf.
* The 3rd pdf if opened told the team if they were on the right track or not i.e. whether they were accessing the right folder or not.
* The teams had to solve these questions inside the password protected pdfs which were based on general programming languages C and C++.
* Difficulty level was kept moderately easy.
* Incase of a tie a crossword round was also kept having questions on general computing.
